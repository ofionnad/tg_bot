# Example of a Telegram bot

This was very simple to set up using python-telegram-bot (prerequisite install) and @BotFather on telegram. 

Simply get an API token from @BotFather and then create commands using the python-telegram-bot docs. 

This just replies to a couple of commands, and welcomes users to the group chat, but the functionality here could be extended a great deal.
