# freelance telegram bot

I was asked to set up a bot with some functions for a group on telegram.

This was very simple to set up using python-telegram-bot (prerequisite install) and @BotFather on telegram. 
Simply get an API token from @BotFather and then create commands using the python-telegram-bot docs. 

The bot replies to a couple of commands, and welcomes users to the group chat, but the functionality here could be extended a great deal.
The bot can also search each new message for a keyword, which triggers a result.
